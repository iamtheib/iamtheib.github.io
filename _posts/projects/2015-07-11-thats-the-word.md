This was my first 'non-single-source-file' project I worked on,
that wasn't a school project.

It was during my second year in university and I was taking this
introductory course to data structures.

There is this phone app, called 4 Pics 1 Word, that I would use to pass
time. If you don't know what that is, it's a game where you're
shown 4 pictures, a bunch of letters (I forgot how many), a set amount
of spaces (where you will put your answer), and your task is to fill the
spaces with letters from the ones you're given, to form a word that
describes all four pictures.... fun stuff

I got to some pictures that I had no idea what they could possibly have
in common, or my guesses were just wrong. I ended up having to spend some
coins (virtual ofcourse), to unlock the answers, and after seeing them,
I thought, 'Obviously'..... It was easy to recognize the answer once you
see it.

To cut the story short, I ended up making something to help me beat
this game by showing me all the possible answers, and by using my
awesome recognition skill, I could pick out the right one. Errmm...
it's not cheating if you still have to recognise the answer..... I think..

Ofcourse, my first implementation was very basic, with just ArrayLists
storing the possible words and searching through that. However, after
learning a bit more about data structures, I switched to using a Trie
instead.
