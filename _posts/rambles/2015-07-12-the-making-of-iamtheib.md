I never thought I would be making websites, and now I have a personal
one.

<!--more-->

**Note: This is not a tutorial on how to make a website**

The first option I opted for was to use NodeJS, Express... the whole
crew... to make my own website, since it was the only one, of the plethora
of website development frameworks out there, I was most comfortable with.

I had started development, when I started thinking about hosting. While they are some free [NodeJS hosting platforms](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Node-Hosting)
out there, with their catches of course, I just wanted to go for a
guaranteed, easy-to-deploy hosting.

After some investigation and searching through multiple forums,
I came to know about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and Github Pages.
Needless to say, I loved it. Simple, easy to configure and best of all,
very free.

I started off with the [Agency Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/agency/)
from the Jekyll Themes webpage. I thought it was pretty cool looking.
Hacking my way through the source code for this theme pretty much opened
my eyes to a lot of the things Jekyll had to offer.

After playing around with the theme for a while, I thought it wasn't dark
enough for me, and I also wanted it to be really simple looking, so I
went through refactoring evey part of the code to my liking.

After I had the looks down, I started experimenting with some javascript
and Jekyll plugins to get the interaction to something I liked. I think
this was the part I spent most of my time. Writing custom scripts and
trying out different libraries and plugins to get the feel I wanted.
I learned a lot about Jekyll and front-end development through this
process.

After the skeleton was done, it was time for content. This part had
me stumped. I wanted to populate my portfolio with projects that
were not assigned in school and were long enough to be considered
projects and not just a bunch of scripts I wrote to quickly solve
a problem I was having that one time (which seems to be most of what
I do). I realised I didn't have that much projects that fit this
criteria. Luckily, I was able to find one or two that could be turned
into projects with brief dusting here and there.

Now, I had pretty much everything done, but was still waiting to
finish dusting those old projects. After a couple of weeks and still
waiting for the dusting to come to completion, I decided to publish what
I had sitting there, and add the rest as they get completed.

All in all, it was/is a really fun experience that's motivating me to
get more projects done...
